# Timetracker

Small time tracking React app using GraphQL & Fabric UI.

Manage clients & their project and your employees & their time sheets.

I chose to use [Graphcool](https://graph.cool) as GraphQL API but 
you can use any GraphQL API as long as the schema stay the same. If
you choose to use another API you may have to rewrite the register &
sign in mutations.

## Quick deploy

1. Clone the repo
2. Click [![graphql-up](http://static.graph.cool/images/graphql-up.svg)](https://www.graph.cool/graphql-up/new?source=__SCHEMA_URL__)  to deploy your GraphQL API
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run`
5. Enjoy!
